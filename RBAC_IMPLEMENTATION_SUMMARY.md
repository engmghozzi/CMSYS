# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a strict role-based access control system for the Laravel Livewire HVAC app, removing per-user feature customization and implementing role-only permissions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Structure
- **Removed**: `user_features` table (migration created: `2025_01_20_000000_remove_user_features_table.php`)
- **Kept**: `roles`, `features`, and `role_features` tables
- **Structure**: Users inherit permissions only from their assigned role

### 2. New Middleware
- **File**: `app/Http/Middleware/EnsureCanManageFeatures.php`
- **Purpose**: Restricts feature/role management to super_admin and admin users only
- **Registered**: In `bootstrap/app.php` as `can_manage_features`

### 3. Updated Models

#### User Model (`app/Models/User.php`)
- **Removed**: `features()` relationship method
- **Removed**: `grantFeature()`, `revokeFeature()`, `syncPermissions()`, `clearPermissionOverrides()` methods
- **Updated**: `hasFeature()` method to check role-based permissions only
- **Updated**: `hasPermission()` method to check role-based permissions only
- **Updated**: `getAllPermissions()` to return role permissions only
- **Updated**: `getEffectivePermissions()` to work with role permissions only

#### Feature Model (`app/Models/Feature.php`)
- **Removed**: `users()` relationship method
- **Removed**: `getAssignedUsers()` method
- **Updated**: `getUsageStats()` to work with roles only
- **Updated**: `canBeDeleted()` to check roles only

#### Role Model
- **No changes needed** - already properly structured for role-based permissions

### 4. Updated Controllers

#### RoleController (`app/Http/Controllers/RoleController.php`)
- **Added**: Admin restriction checks preventing modification of super_admin role
- **Updated**: `edit()`, `update()`, `destroy()`, and `updatePermissions()` methods
- **Added**: `Auth` facade import for proper authentication checks

#### FeatureController (`app/Http/Controllers/FeatureController.php`)
- **Removed**: User-related functionality
- **Updated**: Methods to work with roles only
- **Added**: `Auth` facade import

#### UserController (`app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`)
- **Removed**: User-specific feature management
- **Removed**: `permissions()`, `updatePermissions()`, `clearOverrides()` methods
- **Updated**: `store()`, `edit()`, `update()` methods to remove feature handling
- **Simplified**: User creation/editing now only handles basic user data and role assignment

### 5. Updated Routes (`routes/web.php`)
- **Protected**: Role and feature management routes with `can_manage_features` middleware
- **Removed**: User permission management routes
- **Grouped**: Admin-only routes under middleware protection

### 6. Updated Middleware
- **CheckPermission**: Updated to use `hasFeature()` method instead of `hasPermission()`

## Business Rules Implemented

### Super Admin
- ✅ Can do anything, ignoring all restrictions
- ✅ Can manage all roles and features
- ✅ Always returns `true` for `hasFeature()` checks

### Admin
- ✅ Can manage features for roles other than super_admin
- ✅ Cannot downgrade or remove super_admin permissions
- ✅ Cannot edit, update, or delete super_admin role

### Other Roles (Client, etc.)
- ✅ Cannot alter features or role assignments
- ✅ Inherit permissions only from their assigned role
- ✅ No individual feature customization

## Permission Flow
1. **User Authentication**: User logs in and gets assigned a role
2. **Role Assignment**: User's permissions are determined by their role's features
3. **Feature Check**: `hasFeature($code)` checks if user's role has the feature granted
4. **Access Control**: Middleware and controllers use `hasFeature()` for permission checks

## Security Features
- **Route Protection**: All role/feature management routes protected by middleware
- **Admin Restrictions**: Admins cannot modify super_admin role
- **No User Overrides**: Users cannot have individual feature permissions
- **Role-Based Only**: All permissions flow through role assignments

## Migration Notes
- **Run Migration**: Execute `php artisan migrate` to remove `user_features` table
- **Data Loss**: Any existing user-specific feature permissions will be lost
- **Backup**: Consider backing up user_features data before migration if needed

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Test Super Admin**: Verify super_admin can access all features
2. **Test Admin**: Verify admin can manage roles/features but not super_admin
3. **Test Other Roles**: Verify they cannot access feature management
4. **Test Permission Checks**: Verify `hasFeature()` works correctly for all roles
5. **Test Middleware**: Verify route protection works as expected

## Files Modified
- `app/Http/Middleware/EnsureCanManageFeatures.php` (NEW)
- `app/Http/Middleware/CheckPermission.php`
- `app/Models/User.php`
- `app/Models/Feature.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/RoleController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/FeatureController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`
- `routes/web.php`
- `bootstrap/app.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_01_20_000000_remove_user_features_table.php` (NEW)

## Next Steps
1. **Run Migration**: Remove user_features table
2. **Test System**: Verify all functionality works as expected
3. **Update Views**: Ensure Blade templates work with new structure
4. **User Training**: Inform users about new permission system
5. **Documentation**: Update user manuals and admin guides
